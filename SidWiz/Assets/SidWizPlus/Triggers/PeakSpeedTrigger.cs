    /// 1. Find first zero crossing
    /// 2. Find max sample value after that
    /// 4. Select the zero crossing closest to a following max value
    /// This algorithm is based code from オップナー2608.
    /// This algorithm can show good stability for waves which cross the zero point more than once.
